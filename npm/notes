1. Manage dependencies
   -> Express and its version
   -> We can create our own dependencies.

2. Scripts:
   -> Initial build

-> While doing the initialisation of npm we have to give --yes in it. It is used to give answer to every question as yes.

-> while initialising we can give the dependencies by our own also like.

npm config set init-author-name "Ranganadh"
npm set init - license "Own"
npm init --yes

-> we can install the packages => npm install <package-name>.

-> if we do npm install it will install all the node modules that we are having in npm.

-> Uninstalling packages: npm uninstall package name. => it will no remove the entry.
-> To remove the entry we will use npm uninstall package name --save. => this will removes the entry also.
