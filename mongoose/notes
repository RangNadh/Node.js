Mongoose: It is a schema that is used to model your application data.

-> Schema will creates the key, value pairs for the different data types.

-> Mongoose is helpful for connecting the node application with database.

-> Creating a module => var mongoose = require('mongoose');

-> Then we will set a variable refernce for mongoose schema.
=> var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

Connection ->

        var myDB = 'mongodb://localhost/dbName';
        mongoose.connect(myDB);

-> Here db name can be anything and .connect is used to connect the db.
