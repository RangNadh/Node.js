Node.js:
-> It is uses an event-driven, non-blocking model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

    -> A js runtime built on chrome's v8 js engine.

    -> A platform which allows to run js on a computer/server.

    -> Read, delete and update files.

    -> Easily communicate with a database.

Why node.js is popular?

    -> It uses js.

    -> very fast(runs on the v8  engine & uses non-blocking code).

    -> Huge ecosystem of open source packages(npm).

    -> Great for real-time services(like chats).

JS engines:
-> Computers do not understand JS.
-> A js engine takes js, and converts it into something it does understand - machine code.
